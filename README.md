1. About the app:
   - The app is about displaying the articles to the user. The user can view all the articles on one single page, view more about each article in a separate page by clicking on to the individual article. The articles can also be viewed by topic by going to the topics page and selecting the topic that the user desires to read about.
   - There is a hardcoded logged-in-user for the page, However in order to post a comment, a user log-in is required. For this, the app will redirect the user to the Login page where you could choose a user from an already available list of users.
   - You can also vote on an article.
